Version 1.0
- Made calculator to TOP spec.
- I am proud of this! The code could absolutely be cleaner, but it is the first project where I haven't had to look at someone elses logic to make it work.

To come in later versions:
1. Clean up functions (reduce repetitions);
2. Make more responsive (vertically, check for device compatibility);
3. Add fun 'cats' feature;
4. Fix color onhover on js color;
5. Add error if too many digits.
