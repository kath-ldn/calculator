# Calculator

## About

This is a Calculator App that I built for [The Odin Project Web Development Foundations module, Project: Calculator](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/calculator). It does all the things that you'd expect a simple calculator to do, and includes keyboard navigation. You can also change the color scheme by pressing the top-right buttons.

### Live Demo

[GitHub Pages](https://kath-ldn.github.io/calculator/)

### Built with

* HTML
* CSS
* JS

### Changes from previous version

I revisited this now I have completed The Odin Project Javascript module so that it is now clearer, adheres more to JS good practice, (and is about 1/4 of its original length). I've added additional functionality:
- Updated keyboard navigation;
- Throws error if screen is displaying more than 17 digits (to avoid it spreading across the screen).

I've also updated the UX/UI:
- Simpler and more modern color scheme/layout;
- Simplified display to use flexbox;
- Mobile friendly;
- Subtle animations on interaction.
